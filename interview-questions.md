# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

Your answer:

props are arguments that go into react level components.

Researched answer:

Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.

2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer:
  An action in Javascript called in and or on HTML. i.e onclick events, etc etc.

  Researched answer:

HTML DOM events allow JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document.
Events are normally used in combination with functions, and the function will not be executed before the event occurs (such as when a user clicks a button).

3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer:
  Objects that are designed around an object class. Functional programming forms a basis around functions themselves.

  Researched answer:
  Object oriented programming ia a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Functional programming emphasizes on evaluation of functions. Functional programming uses immutable data while object oriented programming uses the mutable data.

4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: A float in ruby is basically a real number. Integers are basic numbers of count, i.e addition and or subtraction. 2-2, 2+2 etc etc.

  Researched answer: A floating-point number or a float represents a real number. An integer is simply a sequence of digits, e.g., 12, 100. Or in other words, numbers without decimal points are called Integers. In Ruby, Integers are object of class Fixnum(32 or 64 bits) or Bignum(used for bigger numbers).

5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer:
  Methods have implicit returns, so the block of code will be expected to return without implicitly typing the word "return".

  Researched answer: Every block in ruby will return a value of the last line automatically.

1. Instance Variable:

An instance variable is used as part of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to give objects their own private space to store data.

2. PostgreSQL:

 PostgreSQL is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

3. Ruby on Rails:

Ruby on Rails, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages.

4. ORM:

ORM is Object Relational Mapper. It means you don't have to manually call the database yourself; the ORM handles it for you.

5. Active Record:

Active Record is the M in MVC - the model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic. Active Record facilitates the creation and use of business objects whose data requires persistent storage to a database. It is an implementation of the Active Record pattern which itself is a description of an Object Relational Mapping system.
